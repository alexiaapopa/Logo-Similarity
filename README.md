# Logo-Similarity
Match and group websites by the similarity of their logos. 
This project is composed of several distinct modules, each addressing a specific stage of the logo processing workflow:

URL File Processing: Initial parsing and validation of the URL addresses from the input file.
Logo Extraction: The automated retrieval of logos from the processed URLs.
Logo Grouping by Similarity: The categorization of extracted logos based on their visual similarity.
Additionally, this project includes the relevant outputs generated by these processes, alongside a utility program specifically designed for filtering and validating the URL addresses.
You will find also a presentation in pdf format.
